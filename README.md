# raspberrypi-media-player
An Omxplayer-based simple Raspberry pi mp3 and mpg player
This code is for a Raspberry Pi with the Button-SHIM, which gives you 5 buttons and some LEDs.
It is written for two playlists, because I sometimes listen to spoken courses and sometimes music. The paths for the two source directories are hard-coded, currently.
What did I learn from doing this?
The button-shim is brilliant!
The omxplayer Python wrapper has a lot of functionality, so time spent understanding its source code will be well worth while. 
TODO: Rewrite as a class with get /set instead of globals, Add web frontend to control player.
